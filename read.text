Considerations:
-To set up the database (if this is not set, run the following command: ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan migrate)
-To run the server (laravel) run the command: ./vendor/bin/sail up
-Then i decide to create additional table to store the educacion levels, there is a additional command to up the default values to the table copy and paste in a terminal "./vendor/bin/sail php artisan db:seed --class=EducationLevelSeeder"
-The logic of opearation i set is to first register the employees or companies, then to register a position ies needed a company have been created, the position is created to the companies, then to create a employee "contract" the user need to "Enter" the company using the link placed on the Company name and then select the position and the employee to set, the start time of the contract (for now is set by default in the current time the registered is placed)
