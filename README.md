Considerations:
-in the root of the proyect (employes_service) run the followings command: 
-composer install


-Then i decide to create additional table to store the educacion levels
-The logic of opearation i set is to first register the employees or companies, then to register a position ies needed a company have been created, the position is created to the companies, then to create a employee "contract" the user need to "Enter" the company using the link placed on the Company name and then select the position and the employee to set, the start time of the contract (for now is set by default in the current time the registered is placed)
